using this link we can create a mock Api for testing the response of the api in the app without the need to connect to the real api

Dio:
  Send network requests (GET, POST, etc.).
  Manage connection timeouts, retries, and other HTTP settings.
  Handle response data.

Retrofit automatically generates a concrete implementation called _AppServicesClient when you build your project.
  It integrates with Dio to make HTTP requests.
  This generated class handles all the network details, such as:
    Setting headers.
    Serializing request data (e.g., converting Dart objects to JSON).
    Deserializing response data (e.g., converting JSON to Dart models).

pretty_dio_logger: logs the request and response in 

build_runner: used to generate code from json and to json files
