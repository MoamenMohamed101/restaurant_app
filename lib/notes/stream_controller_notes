StreamController improves stream management between view and view model

StreamController =  sink + stream

sink is the input of StreamController

stream is the output of StreamController

At the end of the stream we need to close the stream controller to avoid memory leak

At the end of the stream may be there is a lot of listeners or 1 listener
